/**
 * Executor service where a key is provided along with the task to be submitted,
 * and all tasks that are submitted with the same key (as per {@link Object#equals(Object)})
 * are guaranteed to be executed synchronously in relation to each other (e.g. two tasks
 * submitted with the same key will never be executed at the same time).
 * Tasks with different keys may be ran sequentially in the same thread or
 * parallelized across multiple threads, at the implementation's discretion.
 * <p>
 * <tt>null</tt> is a valid request key. Using the submission methods that
 * do not take a key (the ones specified in {@link ExecutorService}) is
 * the same as using <tt>null</tt> as a key.
 * <p>
 * If all requests are submitted using the same key, any implementation of
 * this type functions the same as a single-threaded executor. However,
 * there is no guarantee that the load will be equally spread among the
 * pool when the keys are different.
