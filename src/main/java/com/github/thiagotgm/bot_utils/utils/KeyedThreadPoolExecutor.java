/**
 * Executor that functions similarly to a {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} in that
 * submitted tasks are executed in one of multiple threads, but instead
 * of executing each task in an arbitrary thread of the pool, a key is
 * provided when submitting a task that defines which thread will execute
 * that task (based on the {@link Object#hashCode() hash code} of the key).
 * Multiple tasks submitted using the same key are guaranteed to be executed
 * by the same thread (and thus one at at time), which allows the use of
 * parallelization for executing a number of tasks while ensuring that certain
 * groups of these tasks are synchronized as necessary.
